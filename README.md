## About Me
I design and build modern, accessible user interfaces and robust backend services. I focus on clean design systems, delightful UX, and maintainable engineering. I enjoy turning product ideas into polished, production-ready software.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: a modern UI library and a scalable microservice for real-time analytics.
- 🌱 I’m learning: advanced UX patterns, performance tuning, and observability.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: design systems, open-source UI components, and high-scale APIs.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe micro-interactions can make or break an experience.

If you'd like, I can:
- Customize the design (dark/light theme, accent color).
- Add animated header or SVG hero.
- Generate a short tagline and bio variants for different audiences (product, open-source, employers).
- Automatically populate project tiles from your GitHub repos.

Tell me the details below and I'll update this README to match your personal brand and priorities.
